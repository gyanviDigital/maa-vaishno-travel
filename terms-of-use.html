5.Unless specified otherwise, all meter readings/distances/timings will be calculated to and fro from our vendors&rsquo; garage.<br />
6.Distances between two locations (points) be it an intercity distance or from vendors garage etc mentioned on the website are approximate. Actual distance may differ depending on the exact geographical location of the points under consideration.<br />
7.Car air-conditioner will not work on hilly routes &amp; also when the vehicle is not in motion. The customer is also not expected to request driver to make the air condition operational in the aforementioned cases.<br />
8.Any form of discounts are only applicable only on the basic fare and cannot be made available on extra charges like toll, taxes, charges on for extra Kms consumed if applicable, charges for extra hours consumed if applicable, driver allowance, parking, night charges, unless specified.<br />
9.The vehicle booked will be subject to availability. In a case where the car booked is not available on the day of travel the customer will be provided with an alternative equivalent vehicle in the similar segment as applicable.<br />
10.It may happen that for some travel routes, the cab model which was reserved earlier by a customer online will not be able to actually run during travel due to the prevailing road conditions (OR) the probable danger of natural disasters. The reasons mentioned are beyond the control of Bharat Taxi. In such a case Bharat Taxi will provide an upgraded cab model which is typically used in that region at an additional charge. If the customer does not want Bharat Taxi to provide an upgraded car model a refund will be made.<br />
11.Airport Pick/Drop, Railway Pick/Drop and local car rental services are valid only within city limits. For the afore mentioned car rental services any request for out station travel beyond city limits will entitle the driver to deny services without any liability to refund the booking amount.<br />
12.Customer is liable to pay waiting charges in the case of delay (be it for any reason) exceeding more than 30 minutes from the scheduled pick up time.<br />
13.Customer is liable to pay for any additional distance traveled and also for additional hourly charges if applicable. Any unscheduled changes will attract additional charges as applicable.<br />
14.All bookings under consideration are on a calendar day basis i.e. from midnight 12:00 to midnight 12:00. As an example for a cab booked for 1st Jan where the pickup time is 5:00 p.m. the booking will be valid till 1st Jan 11:59 p.m. and not 2nd Jan 5:00 p.m.<br />
15.Cabs that are booked for outstation (any or all of One way, round trip &amp; multicity) cannot be used for local travel. As an example if a customer books a cab from Mumbai to Shirdi then to Pune and back to Mumbai for a period of 3 days in total &amp; has a predefined Km limit of 750 Kms and he returns back to Mumbai on the second day &amp; has a balance Km limit of 50 with one day remaining, in spite of this he is not entitled to consume this 50Kms for local travel in Mumbai (Source city), however the customer can travel from Mumbai to some other city outside city limits of Mumbai (say Thane) &amp; consume the remaining 50 Kms or more than this by paying additional charges.<br />
16.One way car rental services have all travel charges like toll, taxes etc applicable when the vehicle returns back to its original location (garage) after dropping the customer to his destination. As example if a customer avails one way car rental service from Pune to Mumbai, he will have to pay all charges applicable while the vehicle returns back from Mumbai to Pune. The total charges to be borne by the customer for this return trip will be slightly lower than the charges for the first trip i.e. from Pune to Mumbai.<br />
17.If needed, a customer can amend his booking from one way to round trip or from one way to multi city while his travel is in progress. A request for amendment while mentioning the CRN number &amp; reason for amendment has to be made to the support team at Bharat Taxi by reaching them on 09696000999. Whether or not to make an amendment as per the request of the customer solely rests with our support team. If the amendment request by the customer is approved our support team they will guide on the difference amount to be paid to the driver as to make the amendment a reality. This amount has to be paid immediately to the driver in cash after our team makes an amendment, failure to do so will not make the requested amendment a reality.<br />
18.The driver will wait for the customer on the travel date for not more than 60 minutes from his pick up time in a case the customer does not inform the driver on the delay, after 60 minutes the booking will be considered as a case of no show and full booking amount will be forfeited.<br />
19.For all travel types (one way, round trip &amp; local) customer has to bear all extra charges like driver allowance, toll, taxes, charges on for extra Kms consumed if applicable, charges for extra hours consumed if applicable, parking charges, night charges and any other charges applicable as mentioned on the voucher.<br />
20.For one way outstation trips the customer will pay for any additional charges in the case where the driver needs to cover additional distance (or) needs additional duration to complete his return journey (whichever of these two higher).<br />
21.Transfers with unspecified distance coverage will only include one way transfer either from airport or railway station to a single location or vice versa. Pickups or drops from multiple locations are not included in such bookings.<br />
22.Cumulative amount of monetary discount shown on our website is only for indicative purpose. The exact discount amount or savings offered depends on the service type.<br />
23.Bharat Taxi cannot be hold accountable for any delay or consequential loss caused to the customer due to traffic jam or reasons beyond reasonable control of the driver or lapses on the part of the driver.<br />
24. Bharat Taxi cannot be held accountable for any loss, damage, physical injury, and loss of life,&nbsp;etc suffered by the customer while availing its services.<br />
25.In case of any misconduct or misbehaviour by the driver the customer should immediately report to the support team of Bharat Taxi at 09696000999 and share the experience while mentioning the booking reference number.<br />
26.Bharat Taxi cannot be hold accountable for any loss, damage or delay suffered by the customer due to force majeure events.<br />
27.In no event the entire liability of Bharat Taxi for any loss or damage arising due to cab services or in the case of a valid refund claim shall not exceed the booking amount paid by the customer.<br />
28.In case of any dispute parties agree to the exclusive jurisdiction of courts of Gorakhpur, Uttar Pradesh.<br />
29.In addition to all the above mentioned terms &amp; conditions, user terms mentioned on the website apply.<br />
30.In a scenario, where in a customer already has received the driver &amp; cab details and the cab hired does not show up on the day of travel, it will be considered as the failure of the fleet partner of Bharat Taxi. Bharat Taxi being an on-line car aggregator will take all necessary efforts to provide the customer an alternative mode of transport immediately, in the shortest possible time &amp; if failing to do so will provide the customer a full refund, which will be processed in a maximum 7 days from the day the cab travel was scheduled to begin. Bharat Taxi is not liable to reimburse its customer for any expenses like hotel stay charges, flight ticket charges or any other type of monetary expenses which the customer had to bear as a result of no show of the cab on the day of planned cab travel.<br />
31.Bharat Taxi may use the mobile number &amp; email ID shared while making an online booking/ registration with it (or) which is shared while filling its inquiry form for its promotional purposes. Bharat Taxi promises that the data will never be sold to any other business entity &amp; will be solely used for its own promotional purposes.<br />
32.It may happen that for some regions that the cab model which was reserved earlier by a customer online cannot be actually made available due to restrictions by local cab associations in that geography, which are beyond the control of Bharat Taxi.
